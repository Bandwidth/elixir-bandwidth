defmodule Bandwidth.Resources do
  @moduledoc """
  The Resources module is a simple abstraction of the REST resources provided
  by the Bandwidth Application Platform API.

  Usage of functions in this module and its enclosed modules will require
  knowledge of the Bandwidth Application Platform API. For example, knowing
  which return codes to expect for certain resources will be required.

  If you are interested in a higher level abstraction, look at the Models module.
